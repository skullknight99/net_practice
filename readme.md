# NetPractice

This project is a general practical exercise to let yo discover networking.

## Introduction to networking

1. **What is networking?**

**Computer networking** refers to interconnected computing devices that can exchange data and share resources with each other. These networked devices use a set of rules, called communications protocols, to transmit information over physical or wireless technologies.

2. **What are communications protocols?**

**Communications protocols** is a system of rules that allow two electronic devices to connect the data with one and another. **Communications protocols** are important because they assist network devices to converse with each other by transmitting the analog signals, digital signals, different files & process the data from one device to other devices.

## TCP/IP addressing

1. **What is TCP/IP?**

**TCP/IP** stands for **transmission control protocol/internet protocol** and is a suite of communication protocols used to interconnect network devices on the **internet**. **TCP/IP** is also used as a **communications protocols** in a private computer network (an intranet as an example).

Common **TCP/IP**

2. **How does TCP/IP work?**

**TCP/IP** uses the **client-server** model of communication in which a user or a machine (a client) is provided a service, like sending a webpage, by another computer (a server) in the network.

### Concepts applied:

1. **IP Address**

Ip address is short for internet protocol address and it is the standard way of communication for computers. Each computer has its own unique number. When two computers communicate, they use their IP addresses to locate and recognize each other.

Ip addresses are written as a set of 4 numbers (called octets) between 0 and 255 separated by a point, example: 198.162.1.12...
